how to say,  indirectly
459 but cant tell

The sunsets are beautiful, and I love you dearly,
But it seems you don't know, because i can't tell my feelings fairly
Just like the sunset, as it doesn't see,
That I watched until its last glow faded for me.

 //but does it know i watch until its last glow fade?

its here been for so long as i have been here for you
